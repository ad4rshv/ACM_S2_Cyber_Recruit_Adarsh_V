Problem Description
An image of an ancient structure and a short quote were provided.
There was no useful metadata or direct location mentioned.
The task was to identify the structure and the state where it exists.

APPROACH:
I started by carefully observing the image instead of relying fully on the storyline.(Some of the detials didnt match the image.)
Noticed a deep stone structure with repetitive, symmetrical steps on all sides.
The design looked functional rather than defensive, suggesting a cooling or water-related structure.
The quote “Built to defeat heat, not enemies” reinforced this idea.
Based on these observations, I searched on Google using terms like
“ancient stepwell with symmetrical stone steps”.
The search results showed images and articles related to Indian stepwells.
On comparing similar structures, the image closely matched Chand Baori.
Further reading confirmed that Chand Baori is located in Rajasthan.

Final Answer
flag{chand_baori|rajasthan}
