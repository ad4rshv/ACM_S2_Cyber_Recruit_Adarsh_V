PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
I was given a interior image and a short quote.there was no metadata,no filenameand no direct clues.
the task was to identify the place and the city name,where the  photgrsgh was taken.

APPROACH:
i observed the key phrases given in the storyline and the image
1)Chandeliers made of bones
2)Skulls arranged symmetrically
3)Gothic vaulting
and observed the image and i searched on my browser:- 

'a building where Chandeliers are made of bones ,
Skulls arranged symmetrically and has Gothic vaulting and HAS A SHEILD MADE OF HUMAN BONES.

after the search i saw multiple articles and images that match photgragh.
dirst result was from wikipedia and from there i found the place and the city:-Sedlec Ossuary in Kutná Hora(Czech Republiic).

from the qoute that was given in the storyline,i tried to search it up directly but i found no direct results to the Sedlec Ossuary 
but i could understand the coorelation between the quote and the photogragh hence conforming the association bwetween the both.

FINAL ANSWER: flag{sedlec_ossuary_kutna_hora}
