Problem Description:

-The main objective of this task was not just to run the given application, but to understand how it works and how cybersecurity concepts are applied in a practical way. The task encouraged me to think about the   flow of a cyber incident and the reasoning behind each action, rather than only focusing on the final result.
-The application simulates a cyber security incident and guides the user through different stages, helping convert theory into a simple interactive experience.

Purpose of the Application

-The purpose of this application is to help non-technical users understand how a cyber incident usually happens and how it should be handled.
Instead of directly explaining concepts, the application:
*Shows alerts
*Asks quiz questions
*Lets users take decisions
*Scores answers based on response
*This makes learning more engaging and realistic compared to traditional learning methods.

How the Application Works

The application moves through different stages of a cyber incident, such as detecting suspicious activity, controlling damage, cleanup, and prevention. Each stage must be completed before moving to the next, which shows that incident response follows a proper order.

The quiz format forces the persion to think logically and act like they are handling a real situation.

My Quiz Performance:

-I completed the quiz in 12.93 minutes, which shows active involvement without rushing.
 My final score was 70 out of 100, with the following breakdown:
*Correct instincts: 30 points
*Right decisions: 30 points
*Explanation: 10 points

The MCQ questions was easy to understand. The explanation questions made me think more deeply, but due to basic keyword-based evaluation, some answers did not get full marks even though the logic was correct. This helped me understand the limitation of automated scoring systems.

Overall, the quiz felt more like a real decision-making exercise than a normal test.

Observed Limitations:

-While analyzing the application, I noticed a few limitations:
*Some sensitive values are hardcoded
*Data resets on restart
*Explanation scoring is basic
*Debug mode is enabled
*These are acceptable for a learning simulation but not ideal for real-world use.

I Learned:

From this task, I learned:
*How cyber incidents follow a step-by-step response flow
*Why sessions are needed due to HTTP being stateless
*How automated systems evaluate user responses
*The importance of understanding how a system works, not just using it
*This task helped me think more like an engineer instead of only focusing on getting correct answers.

Conclusion:
-Overall, this task was a good learning experience that combined logical thinking with basic technical understanding. The quiz-based approach made cybersecurity concepts easier to understand and more engaging. It  showed how complex ideas can be simplified without losing their core meaning.
