# ACM_S2_Cyber_Recruit_Adarsh_V
I’m Adarsh from CSE(AI) Department in sem2, and this repository has my solutions and approaches for the ACM Student Chapter SIG Cyber S2 recruitment tasks.
I am a beginner in cybersecurity and started learning through this
recruitment process. I am interested in cybersecurity because i love problem-solving, logical thinking, and understanding how
systems work and fail.
I am excited to learn through these challenges.
